## Stories
### Guide the mouse through surviving a threat from a lion for the first time
As a mouse
I want a guide to surviving a lion's threat
So that I can live

### Story snippet
Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her. "Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."   
The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.
